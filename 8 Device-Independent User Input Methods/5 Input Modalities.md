# Input Modalities

## Web content SHOULD NOT restrict use of input modalities available on a platform except where the restriction is essential, required to ensure the security of the content, or required to respect user settings

The exceptions are flimsy. Security should not be an issue except in unusual circumstances. One I can think of is with a gaming device regulated by gambling laws where the user could gain an advantage by using a different kind of device.

Limitations around functionality of the page could include a website that teaches the user to type with a keyboard. Restricting the use of voice input doesn't seem necessary though.
