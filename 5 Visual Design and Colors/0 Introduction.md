# Introduction

This module focuses on visual accessibility techniques for people who can see, but maybe not with perfect acuity or color perception.

People need to magnify the screen, use high-contrast colors, or cannot see some colors. 

People with reading disabilities and some cognitive disabilities may have perfect vision, but their brains may not be able to process visual signals such that they have difficulty distinguishing or understanding visual elements on a screen.
