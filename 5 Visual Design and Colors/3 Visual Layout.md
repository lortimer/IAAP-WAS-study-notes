# Visual Layout

## Visual "White Space"

### Blocks of content SHOULD be visually separated and distinct from each other, via margins, padding, or other methods of achieving visual "white space."

Text is very hard to read if it is too close to another element, especially if that element also contains text.

#### Examples:

##### Good:

In the screenshot example below, there is a good amount of space between the text, images, and other elements on the web page that enhances the readability of the web page.

<img src="https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/module-visual-design/sufficientspaceelements.png" alt="" style="border: 1px solid rgb(47, 47, 47); --darkreader-inline-border-top: #7d7466; --darkreader-inline-border-right: #7d7466; --darkreader-inline-border-bottom: #7d7466; --darkreader-inline-border-left: #7d7466;" data-darkreader-inline-border-top="" data-darkreader-inline-border-right="" data-darkreader-inline-border-bottom="" data-darkreader-inline-border-left="" width="650">

The spacing between the three columns in this example makes it easier to distinguish the columns from each other.

##### Bad

In this screenshot, the text is extremely close to the images and sidebar on the web page, making the web page more difficult to read.

<img src="https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/module-visual-design/insufficientspaceelements.png" alt="" style="border: 1px solid rgb(47, 47, 47); --darkreader-inline-border-top: #7d7466; --darkreader-inline-border-right: #7d7466; --darkreader-inline-border-bottom: #7d7466; --darkreader-inline-border-left: #7d7466;" data-darkreader-inline-border-top="" data-darkreader-inline-border-right="" data-darkreader-inline-border-bottom="" data-darkreader-inline-border-left="" width="500">

The three columns in the screenshot below are very close together and it is difficult to distinguish one column from the next column. The text the columns run together, decreasing the readability of the columns.

## Visual Proximity of Labels

### Labels SHOULD be visually adjacent to their controls

Labels for form inputs should be close to the inputs themselves and it should be obvious which input goes with which label.

The example they give here is of a button with a down arrow in it, indicating that a table is sorted by that column. In the bad example, the down arrow is about halfway between two table headers, and the columns don't have vertical lines dividing them, so it's hard to tell which column is sorting the table.

## Layout Design to Enhance Visual Discoverability

### The layout SHOULD have only one main visual focus

In the example below, there are several things competing for the user's visual attention. There is an enormous ad at the top of the page (It is a photo of 30 or so yellow balloons, with the text "Save a little more today for a retirement you'll love"). Below the ad is the main navigation menu. Below that is another ad; it's a banner ad which is smaller than the first, but which still takes up most of the width of the design. Below that is the section heading in large font: "Travel." Below that is a heading ("25 Japanese foods we can't live without"), followed by an enormous photo of a Japanese dinner bowl. The text of the article begins below that image

## The design SHOULD draw attention to the intended visual focus

A great example of this is using a darkened background to draw the user's focus to a modal dialog. The dialog will generally appear in the center and have full contrast.
