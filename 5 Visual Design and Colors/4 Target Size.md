# Target Size

## The touch target size of actionable elements SHOULD be at least 44 pixels by 44 pixels with at least six pixels of inactive space between any adjacent actionable elements

Frequently-used targets should be even larger.

The image below is a green square, 44 by 44 pixels in size and has not been scaled. It demonstrates how big this minimum requirement is. Most buttons that contain text are probably wide enough, but often not tall enough. Many icon buttons are often smaller than this size.

Exceptions to this rule:
- Another target that does the same thing is on the page and meets the size requirement
- The user can modify the target size themselves (zooming the browser mens larger links and buttons containing text)
- The target is included in inline text
- The target is required to be a specific size, and changing it would affect information of functionality
