# Color to Distinguish UI Components

## Color SHOULD NOT be used as the sole method of distinguishing UI components and/or their surrounding content, unless the color contrast between the UI components and/or surrounding content is at least 3:1

The bad example used is 4 lines of text, each with an icon next to it. The first 2 are not buttons, the second 2 are buttons. The only distinguishing feature is that the buttons have blue text - no hover state, no outline, etc.

Ways to make it better:
- Change background color of buttons
- Give the buttons an outline
- Other styling to distinguish buttons from text.
