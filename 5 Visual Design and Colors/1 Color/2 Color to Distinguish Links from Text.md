# Color to Distinguish Links from Text

## Color alone MUST NOT be used to distinguish links from surrounding text unless the color contrast between the link and the surrounding text is at least 3:1 and an additional differentiation (e.g. underline, outline, etc.) is provided when the link is hovered or receives focus

Note, this requires contrast between link text and non-link text. Achieving 3:1 contrast between those colors AND between both colors and the background seems damn near impossible.

Solutions:
- Different color plus underline (the default)
- Different color plus underline the links only on hover and focus
  - This is discouraged, especially in the main body of the document where it is surrounded by non-link text.
- Different background color on hover and focus
- Add and ooutline or border on hover and focus
- Placement in a navigation menu
  - Sighted users understand that items are clickable if the menu is styled in a way that makes it obvious. This is a little subjective, but should be consistent with contemporary design trends.

It's important not to rely only on hover styling to distinguish a link. Users should be able to identify a link just by looking at it.
