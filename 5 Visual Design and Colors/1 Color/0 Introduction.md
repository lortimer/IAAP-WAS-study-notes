# Introduction

We canot use color as the only way we convey information. "Information" here means conveying meaning, as in emphasizing text, distinguishing visual elements from each other, distinguishing dynamic and static elements, and anything else the user is meant to perceive and understand.

**Color choice can be disabling.** Some people may have pain when looking at bright lights, like a white background on a screen.
