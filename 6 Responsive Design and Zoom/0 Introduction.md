Responsive design is not just to make your site look good on different screens, it also ensures that people who need to zoom or magnify the screen have a good experience with the site.

Common tools to zoom may be the browser zoom itself and/or a separate screen magnifier like [ZoomText](https://www.zoomtext.com/products/) by the makers of JAWS, or [other tools](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/lowvision/).

These tools are all super expensive! The JAWS perpetual license is $1,000, or you can pay for it $100 per year. The devices on that scientific page are each between $1,000 and $2,000.
