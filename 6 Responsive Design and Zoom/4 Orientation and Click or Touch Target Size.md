# Orientation and Click/Touch Target Size

## Orientation

### Content MUST NOT restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential

It's important to allow users to choose their display orientation, because sometimes, people can't rotate their monitor. Examples include people with a devices mounted to a wheelchair, people who have difficulty rotating their screen because of a disability, and people with their monitor sitting on a stand.

Exceptions are ok when an orientation is required for functionality. For example, the orientation of a page that allows you to take a picture of a check to deposit it can only be horizontal.

## Click/Touch Target Size

### The click/touch target size SHOULD be large enough to facilitate easy use with a finger, without risking activating an adjacent link or button

Some people have motor disabilities that cause unintentional arm and hand movement. some people don't have fingertips and have to use other body parts to tap a screen like their nose, knuckles, elbow, or toes.

Touch targets should be a minimum of 9.6 mm (0.37 in) wide on a device, and ideally as tall. This height requirement is difficult to achieve for inline links.

Measuring 9.6 mm on a screen is tough, so here are some ways to do that:

For native apps:
- On standard-resolution screens, 44px (Apple) or 48px (Android)
- On double-resolution screens, 88px (Apple) or 96px (Android)

On web pages
- Width of at least 44px, but more is better.

Just because your link is surrounded by a big-enough box doesn't mean you've met the success criterion if the box isn't the touch target.
