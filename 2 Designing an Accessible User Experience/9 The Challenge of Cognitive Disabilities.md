# The Challenge of Cognitive Disabilities

Most neglected type of disability, even by WCAG because:
- The spectrum of cognitive disabilities is wide, both in terms of the types of cognitive disabilities and their severity.
- It's difficult to write rules that can be judged objectively. WCAG's charter requires objective standards.

## What it means to have a cognitive disability

There are many types, severities, and causes. Some people have one, some people have more. The cause doesn't matter for designing a system to be inclusive.

### Complex Concepts

Generally, people with cognitive disabilities struggle to understand things like implied meaning, cause and effect, patterns, procedural logic, hierarchies, and multiple layers of meaning

### Abstractions

Other things that are hard to understand:

- Generalizations - easy to understand specific objects
- Abstract ideas like "justice," or "mercy," or "virtue."
