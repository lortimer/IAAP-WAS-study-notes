# Basic Web Accessibility Checklist for Designers

This checklist is a **starting point**

## Page Title
Should describe the topic or purpose of the page

## Headings
- Text that looks and acts like a heading should be a heading
- Heading levels convey their hierarchy, not chosen just for their default style

## Navigation
- Can you skip repetitive navigation?
- Nav landmark
- Does the content's reading and focus order make sense?

## Links
Should describe where they go

## Color/Contrast
- No information is conveyed by color alone
- Minimum color contrast
- Link text is distinguishable from non-link text by more than just color
- Actionable elements have visible focus styling
- Non-text elements have color contrast of at least 3:1

## Magnification and Responsive Design
- Can a user zoom in on content including on desktop and mobile?
- Design is optimized for all zoom states, eliminate horizontal scrolling
- Can you use the site with your device in any orientation?

## Images
- Alt text for **informative images** provides the same information as the image
- Alt text for **actionable images** identifies what clicking on it will do
- Complex images or infographics are explained with a short text description
- Decorative images are "identified as not requiring alternative text"
- Plain text is used instead of text in images

## Tables
- Have a caption and headers
- Rows and columns are properly identified in the mockup
- Kept simple to eliminate compound headers

## Forms
- All form fields have a label that is always visible
- All labels are adequately descriptive and instructive - all the information you need to fill out the form is present
- All labels are immediately adjacent to their form elements
- Controls are in close proximity to what they control
- Error messages provide enough information for the user to correct the error
- Autofill can be used

## Dynamic Content
- Changes to page are announced and/or come after the element that caused them to appear
- Keyboard-only and touch-screen interactions follow conventional patterns
- Success and failure feedback for all interactions

## Custom Widgets
- Not used in favor of standard widgets when possible
- Full keyboard support and comply with WAI-ARIA authoring practices

## Touch Devices
- Touch targets are large and far apart enough to activate with a big finger
- Alternatives to custom swipe actions and gestures
