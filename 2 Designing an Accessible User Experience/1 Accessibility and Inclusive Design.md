# Accessibility and Inclusive Design

Inclusive Design - Design methodology that seeks to enable and accommodate the full range of human diversity with a unified approach to design, and multiple methods to access the same functionality

Web Accessibility - The qualities that make a web experience available to the most users possible. This is the end result of an inclusive design process. WCAG's POUR is important to this.

Usability - The qualities that make a web experience intuitive and easy to use. The design aligns with the problem being solved and the users solving it.

## Defining Accessibility as the Minimum Goal

Web experiences should be *good*, not just usable.

Guidelines like WCAG are objective and lead to a minimum of accessibility, but they are limited to what can be tested objectively.

Good experiences, especially for people with certain disabilities like cognitive disabilities, are often also based on subjective guidelines. For example:
 - Using visual cues to focus the user's attention
 - Ensuring a font is "easily" readable
 - Minimizing the cognitive skills required. How do you know you're using "simple" language?

Subjective criteria often falls under usability, and the way you know you're doing it right is by observing and interviewing real users.

WCAG 2.1 addressed the limitations of WCAG 2.0 after it was in place for 10 years, including:
 - Cognitive disabilities: https://w3c.github.io/coga/gap-analysis/ and https://w3c.github.io/coga/user-research/
 - Low vision: https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-low-vision-needs-20160317/
 - Mobile and touch devices: http://w3c.github.io/Mobile-A11y-TF-Note/ and https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/mobile-a11y-tf/wiki/New_WCAG_2.0_Techniques
