# User Research with People with Disabilities

Like all software users, people with disabilities have a different experience and perspective from you, and you have to actually observe and interview them to gain an understanding of how effective your design is.

Make your site compliant before testing with users with disabilities, don't waste their time if you haven't done what you can first.

Expect feedback on Usability, too. People with disabilities aren't only concerned with accessibility. They will share their experience, including if it's confusing despite being technically accessible.

Even if their only feedback is on usability, can you say your site is accessible if it is confusing and hard to use?

This section includes good practices for running an observation. I'm not going to take notes on it.

## Which types of disabilities to include in your interviews

As many as possible.

Screen-reader users can help you understand if your structure is adequate and how keyboard-accessible the site is

Screen magnifier users can help you understand things like click-target size, good contrast, and responsive design.

They have varying tech literacy, experience with different sites, expertise with their assistive technology, time with their disability(s), ability to explain their thoughts, creative problem-solving, etc.
