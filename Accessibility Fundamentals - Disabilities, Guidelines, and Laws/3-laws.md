# Accessibility Laws

## 3 Types
- **Civil Rights Laws**: Emphasize equal rights of specific groups. Make discrimination illegal. Enforced by lawsuit.
- **Procurement Laws**: Require accessibility to be considered when buying things like software or hardware. Usually only apply to governments.
- **Industry-Specific Laws**: Written for industries that are crucial to accessibility of public life. Telecommunications and Air Travel both have specific accessibility laws in the United States.


## United States

### The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 
A broad civil rights law prohibiting discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, architecture, transportation, education, and services offering "public accommodation" (e.g. stores and websites).

Applies to:
- Federal, state, and local governments
- Private entities open to the public

### Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 508)
A procurement law requiring the US Gov. to consider accessibility when buying software, hardware, communication devices, etc.

As of 2017, this law requires WCAG levels A and AA. It used to have it's own modified version of WCAG 1.0.

Because the US Gov. is a huge buyer of technology, a lot of state governments and private entities aim for WCAG AA.

All entities subject to FCC regulations like TV broadcasters and manufacturers, phone service providers, etc. have to make their technologies accessible.
