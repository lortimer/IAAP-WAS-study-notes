# Myths and Misconceptions about Accessibility

People are scared of accessibility for lots of reasons and there a lot of myths about it that they use to avoid their responsibilities.

## Myth: Accessibility benefits only a small minority
10%-20% of people have at least 1 disability worldwide at any given time.

Anyone can acquire a disability, especially with age.

Accessibility benefits even people without disabilities.
  - I use captions all the time to help me understand TV
  - Audio descriptions of video help you watch TV without looking
  - Video speed tools help students learn more in less time

## Myth: Accessibility is a short-term project
It's an ongoing requirement. It must be maintained like all other parts of your app.

Disability is a normal part of the human experience. We've always needed accessibility, and only recently begun to recognize that.

### Accessibility must be embedded in the process:
- Business requirements
- Design requirements
- QA requirements and test cases
- Training of new employees
- Ongoing training and professional development for current employees
- Software to detect accessibility flaws

### Company Culture must commit to accessibility
Without visionary leadership and top-level buy-in, efforts are ad-hoc and haphazard.

Full-time jobs have to be working on accessibility. They need authority to make changes and enforce practices.

### Hire people with disabilities
- Reduce stigma on team
- Motivate team to keep it in mind by making disability real
- Have a better idea if your product works for people with disabilities

## Myth: Accessibility should be the last step
- Designing for it is much faster, cheaper, and better.
- It's like security.
- If you don't consider it from the beginning, you may never do it.
- Non-accessibility is a legal liability.

## Myth: Accessibility is hard and expensive
- Starting over is even more expensive
- Lawsuits are way more expensive
- Negative publicity is expensive
- Like TDD or pairing, there is some up-front cost that drastically reduces cost later.

## Myth: Accessibility is ugly
- Most accessibility is completely invisible. If it's ugly, it's your design's fault
- Accommodating cognitive disabilities or making the UI big for people with visual disabilities can affect the look, but that's usually in specific circumstances like blind-friendly touchscreens or a site specifically for a certain population.
