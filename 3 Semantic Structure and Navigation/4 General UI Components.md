# General UI Components

## In content implemented using markup languages, the purpose of User Interface Components, icons, and regions MAY be programmatically determinable.

This is a Success Criterion without a recoomendation for implementation from the W3C.

The idea is that a page would contain metadata that assistive technologies could interpret to give users additional information or modify the page in a customized way.

For example, users who find it easier to understand sets of icons rather than words would be able to place custom set icons on the screen through assistive technology. They could also hide extraneous regions of the page to help them focus on the content they want to see. This would be very helpful to users who rely on familiar symbols (that are customized to their preference) to navigate the web, such as people who may have difficulty with reading, processing, or maintaining focus.
