# Page Title

First thing user hears. For blind users, it's equivalent to glancing at the content of the page to understand what it's about.

Page titles benefit your SEO score.

## A Title for Every Page
### The page `<title>` MUST be present and MUST contain text.
### The page `<title>` MUST be updated when the web address changes.
This is especially important to consider in a Single Page App!

## Meaningful Page Title
### The page `<title>` MUST be accurate and informative
It needs to identify the purpose of the page

### If a page is the result of a user action or scripted change of context, the text of the `<title>` SHOULD describe the result or change of context to the user.
Example: you were on the "Businesses" page, and did a search. Now the page title is "Businesses - Search Results"

Better: "You searched for pharmacies - Businesses"

### The `<title>` SHOULD be concise.
There is no limit, but keep it as short as possible without sacrificing meaning, _Kevin_

Especially don't be a dick and put SEO keywords in the title

### The page `<title>` SHOULD be unique, if possible.
Within one website

### Unique information SHOULD come first in the `<title>`.
For example, if many of your page titles contain your company name, the company name should come last. Makes it easier to distinguish many tabs on same site, and screen reader users don't have to hear the company name every time.

- Good: "Mortgage Calculator - Townsville Credit Union"
- Bad: "Townsville Credit Union - Mortgage Calculator"

### The page `<title>` SHOULD match (or be very similar to) the top heading in the main content.
The title and the `<h1>` in the `<main>` section serve basically the same purpose and should be the same. There is room for variation like leaving branding out of the page heading.
