# 2 Time Limits

## Session Timeout

### If there is a session time limit, users MUST be warned before the session ends and MUST be given time to save their data and/or extend the session.

A 2-minute warning is generally considered enough time.

#### Good Example

### Incomplete data SHOULD be saved after a session timeout.

Users may have to step away or get distracted. Don't assume they want to abandon the information. 

### Users SHOULD be warned of the duration of any user inactivity that could cause data loss, unless the data is preserved for more than 20 hours when the user does not take any actions

This criterion does not apply to content that is timed regardless of inactivity. See below for timed content.

When information cannot be saved for security or other reasons, you have other options:

- Give the user at least 20 hours, regardless of inactivity, to complete the task or form.
- Inform the user of the inactivity time constraint at the beginning of the task so that they can choose to prepare their information ahead of time (so they donâ€™t need to run and find more documents to complete their taxes, for example, risking an inactivity timeout), and make sure any breaks they take or pauses they use to check their work are not too long.
