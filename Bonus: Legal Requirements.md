# Bonus: Legal Requirements

A reminder about the laws that govern accessible web content!

Three types of Accessibility Laws:
- **Civil Rights Laws** make it illegal to discriminate against people with disabilities in certain contexts, like employment, government services, or "places of public accommodation" like restaurants or stores. The **Americans with Disabilities Act** is one example
- **Procurement Laws** require that accessibility is taken into account when an entity is buying goods or services. Examples include Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act in the United States, and EN 301 549 in the European Union. Currently, these laws only apply to government bodies, but they could easily apply to private entities as well.
- **Industry Specific Laws** create requirements for specific industries, like air travel or media broadcasting.

## Stuff I didn't learn in or remember from the CPACC course:

### Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act

A civil rights law signed in 1977 as an amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The first civil rights law in the US to protect people with disabilities from discrimination by requiring any organization that receives federal subsidies to accommodate people with disabilities.

It applies mostly to public sector entities like schools. It has some requirements when it comes to "electronic content".

It is enforced by consumers making formal complaints.
