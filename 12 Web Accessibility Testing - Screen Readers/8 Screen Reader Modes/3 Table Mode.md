# Table Mode

## Multi-directional navigation

When in a table, users can navigate in any direction from cell to cell. The shortcuts for this are Ctrl + Alt (Option) + Arrow keys on Windows and Mac.

## Table headers

When you navigate from cell to cell, the screen reader will read the table headers for that cell if there are any. It will read as many as are associated with the cell.

It usually only reads new header information. If you navigate across a row, it will read the row header and column header for the first cell, then only read the column header after that.
