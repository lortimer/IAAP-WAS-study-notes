# Document/Browse/Scan Mode

## Reading text

The default mode of most screen readers, this allows users to read text and navigate by sentence, word, or letter.

## Navigating by semantic elements

In JAWS and NVDA, Document mode allows you to navigate by semantic elements.

In VoiceOver on MacOS, there are no modes.

In Narrator, you have to switch to scan mode (CapsLock + Space) to navigate by semantic elements.

## Switching modes in screen readers

- NVDA: Insert + Space bar switches between document mode and focus mode
- Narrator: CapsLock + Space turns scan mode on or off.
