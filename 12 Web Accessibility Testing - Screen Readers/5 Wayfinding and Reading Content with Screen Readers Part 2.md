# Wayfinding and Reading Content with Screen Readers Part 2

## Lists

Screen Readers announce what kind of list, how many items, and if there are sublists.

### Show All Lists

ONLY JAWS has this function (at the time the course was published?), with a shortcut of Insert + Control + L

### Navigate from one list to the next
