# ChromeVox

## ChromeVox is a browser reader

ChromeVox is not a full-featured screen reader. It is a browser reader. It can only read the Chrome browser, not the operating system or any other software. The one interesting exception to that statement is on Chromebook computers. On Chromebooks, the operating system is Chrome OS, so ChromeVox does read the operating system in that case, but the number and kinds of applications you can install on Chromebooks is rather limited. On all other operating systems (Mac, Windows, Linux), ChromeVox reads only the Chrome browser and the web content displayed in it.

## ChromeVox is insufficient for testing interactive content

Not as full-featured as other readers. Doesn't read ARIA as well as others.Not commonly used.
