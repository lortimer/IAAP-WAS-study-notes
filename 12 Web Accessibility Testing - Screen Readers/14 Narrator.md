# Narrator

Built into Windows. Has existed for a long time. Reached maturity with Windows 10 Anniversary Edition. For use with Edge.

## Keystrokes and Touch Gestures

The attached guide uses keystrokes from the Standard layout, which is now the default. There is also a legacy layout.

The "Narrator Key" is CapsLock and Insert. Either can be user.

Narrator has navigation settings called views. These are like the element setting on other screen readers. You press CapsLock + PageUp/PageDown to cycle through them, then use CapsLock + Right and Left arrows (I think) to navigate by that element type.

Scan mode: Scan mode allows quick navigation of a web page or application and enables specific keystrokes to navigate by elements such as headings, links, and landmarks. It also includes keystrokes for table navigation. Activate scan mode using Caps Lock + Space Bar.

Developer mode: Developer mode masks the screen, highlighting only the objects and text exposed programmatically to Narrator. This offers a visual representation of the accessibility of the information on the screen and what is exposed to Narrator through UI Automation.

### Touch Gestures

Narrator allows touch gestures for Windows on touch-screen devices.

## Configuration Options

Like others, you can lock the narrator key on or off and toggle reading what is under the mouse cursor.

You can also change voice and verbosity settings.
