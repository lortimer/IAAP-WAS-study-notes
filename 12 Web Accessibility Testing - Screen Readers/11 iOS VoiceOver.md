# iOS VoiceOver

Able to read not only web pages but apps built to use the accessibility API. Very similar to VoiceOver on macOS, except:

- No subtitle window to show spoken text
- Gestures instead of keyboard shortcuts
- No sophisticated table navigation
- Default delay for reading aria-describedby content is 1 second instead of 30.

## Gestures.

See included files for text descriptions and illustrations of gestures.

The unique feature of this screen reader is called the "Rotor". To use it, you twist two fingers on the screen in a circular motion, like turning a knob. This allows you to select what you navigate by using the up or down swipe gestures.

## Configuration Options

You can set up the Accessibility Shortcut (Triple Click) to turn VoiceOver on and off, as well as invert colors, zoom, and others.

VoiceOver overrides default gestures. You can't tap a button to press it, you have to tap it once (or focus it another way), then tap twice to activate.
