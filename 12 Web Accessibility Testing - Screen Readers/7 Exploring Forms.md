# Exploring Forms

Screen reader users often explore forms before filling them out. They can also use "focus" or "forms" mode to use a special set of keyboard shortcuts.

## Enter and exit forms mode

Only available in NVDA and JAWS...

- JAWS: Press enter key when focused on a form field to enter this mode. NumPad '+' button to exit
- NVDA: Insert + Spacebar to enter and exit.

## List all form elements

Again, limited support. JAWS uses Insert + F5. NVDA uses Insert + F7 to open the elements list, then you select form fields. Narrator uses Caps Lock + [F5, F6, or F7], then Tab (twice) to the Scoping drop-down list, then Alt + Down Arrow to open the list, then select Form fields

## Note:

Commands for JAWS and NVDA from here on are in forms mode only.

## Navigate from one form element to the next
