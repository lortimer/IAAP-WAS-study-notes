# Android Talkback

Some devices do not come with Talkback pre-installed. I hope this is less true now than when the course was published.

Like VoiceOver, it can read many things other than web apps, but native apps have to be developed with the accessibility API in mind to work.

Works best with Chrome, and well with Firefox. Before Android 7.0, Firefox is recommended.

## Gestures

Talkback's equivalent of VoiceOver's Rotor is to swipe up then down, or down then up to open the "Reading Controls" menu to select what to navigate by using up or down swip. You can also do a 3 finger swipe in any direction on some devices.

### Configuration Options

There is also an accessibility shortcut on Android devices that can be configured to activate Talkback.

You can customize each gesture to do a different command.
