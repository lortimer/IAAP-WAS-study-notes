"Job Access with Speech" developed by Freedom Scientific. JAWS works well with Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.

## Keystrokes

See included PDF. Freedom Scientific publishes [JAWS training material for users here](https://www.freedomscientific.com/SurfsUp/_Surfs_Up_Start_Here.htm).

## JAWS Configuration Options

The course actually has a bunch of text dedicated to downloading and running the JAWS installer. Then a bunch more about how to run any application on Windows

Surprise, you can configure JAWS with an options menu! I'm not going to take notes on the menu options. Just use the app to find out.
