# macOS VoiceOver

First introduced in Mac OS X 10.4 in 2005

YOU MUST ENABLE KEYBOARD ACCESSIBILITY IN SYSTEM PREFERENCES AND SAFARI PREFERENCES. Google Chrome on macOS allows keyboard accessibility by default.

- In system prefs:
  - Check the checkbox at System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls
- In Safari:
  - Check the checkbox at Safari Preferences > Advanced > Accessibility > Press Tab to highlight each item on a webpage.

## Keystrokes

See the included PDF file. Apple provides VoiceOver user information at www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/

Most VoiceOver commands require the Control and Option keys to be held. You can "lock" them on or off by pressing Control + Option + ";".

### Rotor 

macOS VoiceOver has a rotor like the iOS version. You press Control + Option + "U" to open it, then use the left and right arrow keys to choose between element types. The Rotor also allows you to type with the rotor open to filter down the options.

One of the element types is called "Web Spots". VoiceOver will automatically identify some for you, and you can identify your own.

The Up and Down arrows navigate by the selected element type.

## Configuration Options

As with NVDA you can toggle off mouse-cursor tracking.

You can change the voice pitch and speed.

You can change how verbose it is when reading.

Control + Option + "H" opens a help menu. Press this twice to open the Commands menu to find a keyboard shortcut you don't know.

Control + Option + "K" opens the keyboard menu. Don't know what that does.
