You _can_ use ARIA to create custom widgets that are fully accessible. However, never forget...

## The ARIA Axioms

1. NEVER use ARIA unless you _have_ to
2. ALWAYS use ARIA _when_ you have to
3. You're probably using ARIA wrong

Lots of developers learn about ARIA and go overboard applying it to everything. We must use native elements where possible because they work and people know how to use them.

If you're going to use ARIA to create a custom widget, know that you're signing up for a difficult job that you must do thoroughly. It's not a matter of a few attributes here and there, it is its own model of markup. You have to learn how to use it well, and you will make mistakes the first many times you use it before you understand the reason for the things you're supposed to do.
