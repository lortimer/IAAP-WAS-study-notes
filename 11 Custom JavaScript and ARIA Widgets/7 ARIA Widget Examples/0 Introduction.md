# Introduction

The examples in this directory come from a library of ARIA patterns created by Dequeue Systems, possibly Cauldron or something similar? Their goals:

- To serve as examples of standard-compliant ARIA patterns, aligned with the W3C recommendations and documents:
- Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.1 opens in a new window
- WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1 opens in a new window
- To provide ready-to-go accessible patterns that can be implemented on production web sites.
- To allow multiple instances of any type of pattern from the library on the same page.
- To declare styles, IDs, and classes in a way that minimizes the possibility of interference with other components on the web page.
- To use only plain JavaScript, without any dependencies on third-party libraries or methods (e.g. no jQuery or similar).
- Avoid browser-specific workarounds to the extent possible.


W3C also has a set of patterns to follow, which should be your go-to library:
