# Form Inputs `type="image"`

I have no idea why you would use an `<input type="image" src="..."/>`. I would just use a button.

The example is a raster image of a submit button, which is just about the worst way I can think of to accomplish that

## Form inputs with type="image" MUST have alternative text

## The alternative text for form inputs with type="image" MUST accurately convey the purpose or result of the input action

## The length of the alternative text for inputs with type="image" SHOULD be concise (no more than about 150 characters)
