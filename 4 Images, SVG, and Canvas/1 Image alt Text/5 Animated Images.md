# Animated Images

This page doesn't talk about alt text, but you know the rule: There must be text-based alternatives for all non-text content.

## A method MUST be provided to pause, stop, or hide any prerecorded video-only content that begins playing automatically and which lasts more than 5 seconds

This is for people who find motion distracting or disruptive

## Animated images MUST NOT flash or flicker more than 3 times per second

The Trace Center has a tool called the [Photosensitive Epilepsy Analysis Tool (PEAT)](http://trace.umd.edu/peat) that you can download and use to identify whether your image or animation could cause seizures.
