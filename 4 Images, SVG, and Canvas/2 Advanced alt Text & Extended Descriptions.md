# Advanced alt Text & Extended Descriptions

## An Illustrative Painting

Let's look at the following painting:

<img src="https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/module-nontext/advanced-painting700.png" alt="A painting by John Gast in 1872 titled &quot;American Progress&quot;, described more completely in the explanations below." width="700" height="521">

### Alt Text Options

We can describe it with any of the following alt texts:

1. A painting by John Gast in 1872 titled American Progress
2. A painting by John Gast in 1872 titled American Progress as described below
3. A painting by John Gast in 1872 titled American Progress, showing the spirit
   of America heading westward, accompanied by prospectors, farmers, and settlers
   while Native North Americans and creatures of the land move away before
   her advancements.

### Description Options

Any of them are acceptable. Number 2 is probably the best because it is brief and tells the user there is a longer description below.

Longer descriptions can take many forms:
- A paragraph below the image
- A link to another page below the image
- A button called "Show Detailed Description" below the image which opens a dialog containing the longer description
- A disclosure below the image to show and hide the description

We could write the long description in several ways as long as it aligns with the author's intent in using the image. One way to write the long description would be to "objectively" describe its features and offer as little interpretation as possible. It is unlikely that this particular image would be used in a way where this kind of description would be appropriate.

This image represents a white-American point of view of the genocide of native peoples, so it's most likely to be used in the context of a history class, and art history class, or something like that. It this context, the long description should make clear the intent of the person who put the image in the document.

## Ecology Diagram

### Image

<img src="https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/module-nontext/advanced-ecology.png" alt="A black-and-white ecology diagram, described below" width="767" height="388">

### Alt Text Options
- A diagram showing 5 stages in the progression of forest regrowth.
- A diagram showing 5 stages in the progression of forest regrowth,
  from grasses and annual plants, to shrubs, to oak trees,
  to other trees, and to a mature forest

### Description Options

A literal, uninterpretive description is likely to be appropriate here. It is okay to describe an image literally and objectively when the reader is meant to provide their own interpretation

## Map Directions

Maps's visual vocabulary of symbols, lines, and colors are very difficult or at least very lengthy to convey in words, especially to someone who cannot or has never seen a map.

Maps are also used for many things - getting a sense of the layout of a place, understanding topography or geologic features, finding the distance or relationship between two places, finding a bus stop, going from one place to another, etc. There's no way to predict how a person wants to use a map.

Therefore, creating a meaningful written alternative to a map is essentially impossible. Text for some specific map uses, like directions from one place to another, can be written if the user's intent is known.

### Visual Directions

Looking at a map, you could find your way from one location to another by following lines. A valid text alternative is like directions you would give another person, "go that way until you get to main street, turn left, go 4 blocks, turn right onto first..."
