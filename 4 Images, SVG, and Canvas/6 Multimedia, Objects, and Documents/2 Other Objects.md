# Other Objects

## All `<object>` elements MUST have alternative text

Not very common anymore, but used to nest an external resource like a document or video into the document. Display of the resource is handled by a plugin.

Use `aria-label`. Include a long description if necessary.

This rule applies to objects, but as with all other images, you have to make it accessible with other techniques.
