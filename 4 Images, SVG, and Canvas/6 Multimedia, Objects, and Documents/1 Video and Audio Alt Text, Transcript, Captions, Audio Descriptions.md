# Video and Audio Alt Text, Transcript, Captions, Audio Descriptions

## There is no alt attribute for video and audio

Other ways to provide an alternative include:
- Synchronized captions
- Text Transcript
- Audio Descriptions

## All prerecorded video MUST have synchronized captions

Captions must include all the dialog and narration. They must identify who is speaking. They must also indicate sounds that are important to the video, like applause, laughter, nature sounds in a documentary, etc.

WebVTT (Web Video Text Tracks) is a format for captions. Some operating systems allow users to set caption preferences, like size, color, typeface, etc, and they will respect those choices when playing video that includes WebVTT captions (rather than captions built into the video itself)

## Prerecorded audio content MAY have synchronized captions

In most cases, a transcript is fine, but you can play the captions in time if you'd like.

## All live video with dialog and/or narration MUST have synchronized captions

On TV, this requires a stenographer. A lot of live video on the internet does not have captions, but Google and others like Twitch are working on live captioning technology that is capable of creating mostly-accurate captions on the fly.

## Live _audio_ consisting mainly of dialog and/or narration SHOULD have synchronized captions

It's best even when not necessary. If the audio experience is mainly music or something else, it can be useful to provide a live text description.

## All prerecorded video and audio MUST have text transcripts

Text is the only way for deafblind folks to experience audio or video. The transcript being separate from the video or audio allows users to experience it and explore it in the way that works for them.

## Videos MUST include audio descriptions of important visual content that is not conveyed through the audio

These are descriptions of non-dialog that help people who can't see the video understand what is happening.

I think this is almost never done on the internet and I can't think of anywhere audio descriptions are added automatically to video.
