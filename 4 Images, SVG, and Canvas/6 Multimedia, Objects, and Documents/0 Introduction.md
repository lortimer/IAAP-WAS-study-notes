# Introduction

Content that requires a 3rd party browser plugin or external application presents unique accessibility challenges. Examples were more common 10 years ago with Silverlight and Flash being widespread examples.

Providing an HTML equivalent is the best way to make this content accessible, in case a user doesn't have the plugin or can't use it (or the plugin has major security holes).

Some plugins offer an accessibility API. PDF and MS Office plugins do. The same accessibility rules that apply to HTML content apply to other content.
