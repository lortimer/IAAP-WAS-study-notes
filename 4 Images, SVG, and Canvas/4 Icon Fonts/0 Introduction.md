Icon fonts allow developers to add "images" to a page without the weight of adding an image.

Icon fots respond to user color preferences, like Windows High Contrast Mode, because they are just disguised text.

However, they have downsides:
- They are not accessible by default, and require:
  - semantic role as an image
  - meaningful alternative text
- If the font cannot be loaded, they will appear as nonsense text
