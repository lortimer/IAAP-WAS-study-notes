# Raster versus Vector Graphics

## Vector images maintain their clarity when magnified

I'm not going to write much about this topic since I already understand it so well. Raster images are arrays of pixels with a color value for each. They cannot be scaled well because to scale them, all you can do is stretch the existing pixels. They're great for complex images like photographs as long as you use a source image larger than the display image.

Vector images scale well because they are mathematical descriptions of lines that get rendered at whatever scale you need. They are best for simple images like logos. SVG also makes animation possible with small file sizes because it can be accomplished at runtime. Animated Raster images require larger file sizes.
