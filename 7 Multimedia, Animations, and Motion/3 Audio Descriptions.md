# Audio Descriptions

## Determining When Audio Descriptions Are Needed

The purpose of an audio description is to provide information that can be seen but not heard. A script can be crafted to include all important visual information in the original sound track.

### Prerecorded multimedia (video plus audio) MUST include audio descriptions

Only to convey information that is only presented visually.

### Prerecorded video-only content MUST include audio descriptions OR a text transcript

Transcript is best if you can only do 1 of the 2

### Audio descriptions MAY be provided for live multimedia (audio plus video) content

Trained Audio Describers are increasing in number for events like live theater.

If you capture a live event and present it later, it would then require an audio description.

### Audio descriptions MAY be provided for live video-only content

## What to Include in Audio Descriptions

The target audience is people who can hear but not see, as if you were describing an event to a radio audience.

Examples of relevant information include facial expressions, scenery, and actions that can't be identified by sound.

Audio descriptions are an art form and orgs like the American Council of the Blind's Audio Description Project advocate for higher standards

### General Principles

- The level of description possible depends on the sound track - you have to do audio description between dialog or narration
- Descriptions should inlcude all information important to the plot or characterization - locations, settings, characters, clothing, facial expressions and mannerisms, lighting, colors, etc.
- Descriptions should coincide with the action taking place
- Descriptions should be written in clear, simple language. Technical terms should be avoided unless the context demands it and if possible explained.
- Descriptions should be in present tense.
- New speakers in a scene should be identified.
- Descriptions should not give any more information than the sighted viewer would have.
- The passage of time between scenes should be indicated.
- Visual elements which are imagined or remembered, or are obviously part of a dream, should be differentiated from 'real' events.

###  Writing Style

- The description should give a feel for settings but shouldn't overwhelm people with detail.
- Descriptions should be neutral. Interpretive descriptions, value judgments and aesthetic opinions, e.g. "She looks into the distance, thinking of home", should be avoided.
- The source of unidentified sounds and speech should be described (but only when these would be obvious to the sighted viewer).
- Whole sentences should be used where possible when describing action. It is acceptable though to identify characters by just giving their name, or to describe objects or settings in incomplete sentences (e.g. "A lake with a small island in it.")
- The description should not draw attention to itself. The describer should blend in seamlessly with the rest of the audio.
- The term "we see", and cinematic terms like "the camera zooms in…", "a close-up…" should be avoided.
- Racist or offensive terms should never be used, but ethnicity should be noted when it is essential to plot or character.
- The style of the audio description should match the style of the program. For example, it is acceptable to be more colloquial in children's programs.
- Every gap in dialogue does not need to be filled with description. The music and ambience can tell the story too.

### Sounds

- No description is necessary when there is an obvious audio cue such as a phone ringing.
- If a description must fall on either side of a sound, it is better for it to be before the sound than after.

### Other

- For subtitled films, the appearance of subtitles should be noted in the first instance then prefixed with "subtitle" or "he says", "she says", etc.

- If it is necessary to describe over a song, describing over important lyrics should be avoided.

- Credits at the beginning and end of a video should be read out.

## Extended Audio Descriptions

### Where pauses in foreground audio are insufficient to allow audio descriptions to convey the sense of the video, extended audio description SHOULD be provided for all prerecorded multimedia (video plus audio) content

An extended audio description will periodically pause the video, and should be toggleable by the listener.

## Methods of Presenting Audio Descriptions

### Method 1: Create a separate version of the video with embedded audio descriptions

You can provide links to the multiple versions of the video, or do some other complicated things with Javascript that allow the user to toggle between the different versions.

#### Closed Cpations should include the audio description when one is present 

### Method 2: Create a separate audio file of just the audio descriptions, and allow users to turn on the audio description option to play the audio descriptions synchronously with the video.

Basically, a button on the media player turns on or off the audio descriptions, which means the player has to support multiple audio tracks.
