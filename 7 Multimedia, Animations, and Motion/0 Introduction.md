# Introduction

This course covers the 4 main methods of making video and audio accessible:

- Captions: Text synchronized with the media, for people who cannot hear the spoken words.
- Transcripts: The full text of the spoken words and important visual information in the media file, to read as an alternative to watching or listening to the media file.
- Audio descriptions: A version of the media file with a narrator explaining important visual information (such as unspoken actions and events) for the benefit of people who cannot see what's happening.
- Sign language interpretation: Video of an interpreter, synchronized with the media file (or in the same video frame), for the benefit of people who know sign language.

And the additional considerations for multimedia:

- Clear audio: Prominent background sounds make it difficult for people who are hard of hearing to understand the spoken words.
- Preventing seizures: Flashing visual effects in videos can cause seizures in some people.
- Preventing dizziness: Some people with vestibular disorders can become dizzy, nauseous, or disoriented when there is excessive motion in video or animated content.
- Accessible media player: The media player itself has to be keyboard-accessible and needs to communicate the names, roles, and values of the controls and the states of the controls.
- Preventing auto-play audio interference with screen readers: Media players that auto-play can interfere with screen reader users' ability to hear their screen reader.

They have provided a shortcut table of type of multimedia as it relates to each method of making it accessible, and what level of success criteria applies.
