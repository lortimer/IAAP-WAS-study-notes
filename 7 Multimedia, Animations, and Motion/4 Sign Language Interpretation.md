# Sign Language Interpretation

Some people prefer or even understand sign language better than written language. Sign language can be more expressive than written language, particulary when there's lots of action happening.

## Determining When Sign Language Interpretation is Needed

Essentially, sign-language interpretation is always a AAA level success criterion. 

### Sign language interpretation MAY be provided for prerecorded multimedia (video plus audio)

The best way to do this is to include the interpreter in the same frame in the original video. A picture-in-picture setup works well, also.

### Sign language interpretation MAY be provided for prerecorded audio-only content

Requires a synchronized version of the presentation with a video of the interpreter.

### Sign language interpretation MAY be provided for live multimedia (video plus audio) content

### Sign language interpretation MAY be provided for live audio-only content

## Methods of Presenting Sign Language Interpretation

### Method 1: Picture in Picture (PiP) in the video itself
### Method 2: As a separate synchronized video
### Method 3: Include the interpreter in the original video
