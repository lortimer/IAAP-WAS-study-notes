# What to Include in Transcripts

## Best Practices

There is almost 100% overlap between best practices for captions and for transcripts. Below are unique practices of each:

### Unique Best Practices for Captions

- Captions SHOULD use conventional spelling, rather than attempt to write words phonetically, except when phonetic spelling is essential to the meaning of the content
- Captions SHOULD describe sounds in terms of the sounds themselves, not the actions causing the sounds

### Unique Best Practices for Transcripts

- Important visual events MUST be described in the transcript.

## Transcripts MUST be verbatim for scripted content

Should match the source script (except where the content differs?) and include stuttering, ums, etc.

## Transcripts SHOULD be verbatim for unscripted or live content (with the optional exception of stuttering or filler words -- like "um" -- when transcribing the filler words reduces reading comprehension of the transcript)

## Important visual events MUST be described in the transcript

## Important background sounds MUST be conveyed in transcripts, preferably in [brackets] or (parentheses)

## Speech that is spoken off-screen MUST be captured in the transcript

## The identity of the person speaking MUST be identified in transcripts

## Transcripts SHOULD use punctuation to convey emphasis whenever possible, rather than write extra text to explain the emphasis

## Transcripts MUST NOT reveal intentionally-withheld information in the content before the appropriate time

## Music SHOULD be identified by title and artist whenever possible in transcripts, unless doing so would be inappropriate to the content

## Important music lyrics SHOULD be included in transcripts, if relevant to the meaning of the content

## Transcripts SHOULD indicate when speech is whispered or mouthed

## When speech is inaudible or difficult to perceive clearly, the transcripts SHOULD say so, using neutral language

## Strong language SHOULD be retained and not edited out of transcripts, whenever possible, OR SHOULD be bleeped or muted to match style or content requirements of the intended audience or context
