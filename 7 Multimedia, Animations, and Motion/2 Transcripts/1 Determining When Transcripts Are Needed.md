# Determining When Transcripts Are Needed

Required only for prerecorded audio-only content, but good also for multimedia. Remember, Deaf and blind people need text to acces audio or video content.

## Prerecorded multimedia (video plus audio) SHOULD have a text transcript

Adjacent or easily reachable.

## Prerecorded audio-only content MUST be accompanied by an easily-reachable text transcript

Including dialog, narration, significant sounds, and descriptions.

## Prerecorded video-only content MUST include audio descriptions OR a text transcript

Text transcript is better for deafblind people.

## A text transcript describing the visual aspects of the video SHOULD be provided for video-only content
