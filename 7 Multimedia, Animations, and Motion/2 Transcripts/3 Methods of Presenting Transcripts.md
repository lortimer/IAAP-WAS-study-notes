# Methods of Presenting Transcripts

- Method 1: Place the transcript directly on the page with the audio or video player
- Method 2: Provide a link to the transcript
- Method 3: Provide an interactive transcript, allowing users to access specific places within the video or audio content

The TED talk website has "interactive" captions where sections of the transcript each have a play button associated them that skips to that point in the video. Not only that, but users can click on words or sentences to go to that point in the video. These transcripts highlight the part of the transcript relevant to the video while it is playing, so the transcript can serve as captions.
