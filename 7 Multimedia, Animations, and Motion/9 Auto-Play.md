# Auto-Play

## A method MUST be provided to pause, stop, or hide any media content that begins playing automatically and which lasts 5 seconds or more

This applies to 2 categories of content:

- Moving, blinking, or scrolling content including:
  - movies and synchronized media presentations
  - animations
  - real-time games
  - scrolling stock tickers
- Auto-updating content including:
  - automatically updated weather information, news, and stock prices
  - auto-advancing presentations and messages

It's great to offer a control to allow users to change the frequency at which content updates

The big exception to this rule is, as always, animation that is important to the meaning of the page, like a loading bar.
