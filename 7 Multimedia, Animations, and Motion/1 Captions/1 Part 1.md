## Open Captions versus Closed Captions

Closed captions are included with a video for the multimedia player to display when toggled on by the watcher. How they appear depends on the player itself, and they may be configurable by the user.

Open captions are always present, they are burned into the video during production. They are useful for subtitles or showing a video to a large group for ease of use.

## Prerecorded Multimedia

### All prerecorded video MUST have synchronized captions

They must include all the dialog and narration, identify who is speaking, and describe other important sounds in brackets.

[WebVTT](https://w3c.github.io/webvtt/) is the best format for captions files in terms of user customization, but there are many other options and WebVTT is not supported by YouTube.

## Live Events

### All live multimedia (video plus audio) events that contain dialog and/or narration MUST be accompanied by synchronized captions

This includes webinars, web calls and conferencing, live streams of presentations, and live news.

A Stenographer is the preferred way to get live captions, but since the class was published, auto captions have been added to some software like Google Meet. Many applications don't even have a way for the owner of a meeting or presentation to provide live captions.

### Live audio consisting mainly of dialog and/or narration SHOULD have synchronized captions

Most important with dialog or narration. For music- or sound-only events, a description can be helpful to give Deaf people a sense of the event. A transcript posted after the event may be acceptable.

#### Methods of live captioning a video

1. Use a Media Player that Supports Live Captions
2. Present the Captions on the Web Page Adjacent to the Video
   1. Where the captions update or appear on the page in sync with the video
3. Use Television Captioning Technologies
4. Present the Captions on a Separate Web Page
   1. Not ideal, requires 2 browser windows open at the same time to be useful.
