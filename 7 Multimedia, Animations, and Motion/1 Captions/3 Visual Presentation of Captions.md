# Visual Presentation of Captions

## Captions SHOULD NOT exceed three lines on the screen at a time

## Caption line breaks, when necessary, SHOULD be inserted at logical points between phrases, rather than in the middle of a phrase

New sentence means new caption, unless they are very short sentences.

## Captions SHOULD be typed in mixed case

They used to be all caps, but now should be mixed case. Increases readability.

## The default font for captions SHOULD be a sans-serif font

## The maximum number of characters per line of captions SHOULD NOT exceed 32 characters

## Captions SHOULD remain on the screen for a minimum of 1 second under all circumstances, AND SHOULD take into account the number of words, at 0.3 seconds per word, if possible

## Captions SHOULD be positioned to not obscure on-screen text, people's faces, or other important visual information

When moved, they should be aligned center or left for readability.

Never move a caption within the same frame, only change caption position when the frame also changes.

## Captions SHOULD be precisely synchronized to the audio, except when doing so would make captions difficult to read

If the speech is too fast, this may be impossible without simplifying the captions (that's a last resort)

## The default color combination SHOULD be white text on a black background

## The default contrast ratio between font color and background color in captions MUST be a minimum of 3:1 (assuming a minimum font size of 18 point)

## The default font size for captions SHOULD be at least 22pt

## The default font weight for captions SHOULD be normal (not bold)

## Colors in captions MUST not be used as the only way to convey meaning

## Italics or all caps MAY be used for emphasis in captions when punctuation alone does not convey the full meaning

Italics are the preferred method. Be careful about using too much all-caps text, it makes the text harder to read.

## Quotation marks (or optionally italics or underline, if supported in the caption format) and mixed case capitalization SHOULD be used to designate titles (e.g. of books or movies) when appropriate in captions

## The last caption frame SHOULD be removed from the screen during long silent intervals

Also, for music, the descriptive caption should be removed after 4 or 5 seconds, not displayed the whole time.

## Any gaps in captions SHOULD be a minimum of 1.5 seconds

## Periods of silence SHOULD be noted as such when the visual content gives the impression that there may be important sounds or speech

## Additional on-screen time for a caption frame SHOULD be added when the caption contains unfamiliar or uncommon words or phrases

## Additional on-screen time for a caption frame SHOULD be added when there is a lot happening visually on the screen
