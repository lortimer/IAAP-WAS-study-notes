# What to Include in Captions

## Best Practices

There is almost 100% overlap between best practices for captions and for transcripts. Below are unique practices of each:

### Unique Best Practices for Captions

- Captions SHOULD use conventional spelling, rather than attempt to write words phonetically, except when phonetic spelling is essential to the meaning of the content
- Captions SHOULD describe sounds in terms of the sounds themselves, not the actions causing the sounds

### Unique Best Practices for Transcripts

- Important visual events MUST be described in the transcript.

## Captions MUST be verbatim for scripted content (except when intentionally creating simplified captioning for a relevant target audience, e.g. people with cognitive disabilities).

This includes stuttering, thinking words like "um"

## Captions SHOULD be verbatim for unscripted or live content (with the optional exception of stuttering or filler words -- like "um" -- when captioning the filler words reduces reading comprehension of the captions)

Optimized against being easy to read. If there are too many ums for the caption to be readable, omitting only enough to make it readable is ok.

## Important background sounds MUST be conveyed in the captions, preferably in [brackets] or (parentheses)

Background noise, sound effects, background music, voice tone and inflection. The goal is to create an equivalent experience. Excessive wording may distract the viewer.

## Speech that is spoken off-screen MUST be captured in the captions

Italics are used to show that the speech is coming from someone not in the frame.

## The identity of the person speaking MUST be identified in the captions

Not required if there's only one speaker in the frame and no one else off screen. Upper-case names followed by a colon. E.g. `MICHAEL: Don't. Don't.`

## Captions SHOULD use punctuation to convey emphasis whenever possible, rather than write extra text to explain the emphasis

For example, using an exclamation point instead of `[YELLING]`

### Good Examples
```text
You mean you slept outside in the rain?!

I... I forgot what I was about to say.
```

### Symbols

- `--` for interrupted speech `I can't believe they--`
- `...` for meaningful pauses

## Captions SHOULD use conventional spelling, rather than attempt to write words phonetically, except when phonetic spelling is essential to the meaning of the content

Conventional spelling most of the time allows readers to understand intentional rule breaks. Take this example from The Color Purple

```text
One day, my daddy come and say, "You're gonna do what your mama wouldn't."
```

## Captions MUST NOT reveal intentionally-withheld information in the content before the appropriate time

Don't ruin the surprise

## Music SHOULD be identified by title and artist whenever possible in captions, unless doing so would be inappropriate to the content

This applies to music that is part of the action, i.e. music experienced by the characters. For mood-setting music, you want to convey the mood.

### Good Examples

```text
MUSIC: "Canon in D" by Johann Pachelbel

HE HUMS "Sweet Caroline" by Neil Diamond.

[EERIE MUSIC]
```

## Important music lyrics SHOULD be included in captions, if relevant to the meaning of the content

```text
♪ O say can you see ♪
```

## When speech is inaudible or difficult to perceive clearly, the captions SHOULD say so, using neutral language

"Inaubile" or "unclear" are good. "Unintelligible" is bad. Don't convey qualitative judgment on the character.

## Strong language SHOULD be retained and not edited out of captions, whenever possible, OR SHOULD be bleeped or muted to match style or content requirements of the intended audience or context

Match the style of the video. If the audio track is censored, so should the captions be.

For beeps
```text
What the BLEEP were you thinking?
```

For muted
```text
I can't believe I fell for your s---!
```

For replaced
```text
I've had it with these monkey-fighting snakes on this Monday to Friday plane!
```

## Captions SHOULD indicate when speech is whispered or mouthed

## Captions SHOULD describe sounds in terms of the sounds themselves, not the actions causing the sounds

### Examples

Bad:

```text
(The girl sniffs the bread)
Mm...
```

Good:

```text
(Sniff)
Mm...
```
