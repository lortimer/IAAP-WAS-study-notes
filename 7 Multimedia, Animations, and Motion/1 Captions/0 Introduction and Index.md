# Introduction

Captions are important to help people access media who cannot fully perceive the audio portion of the media. They also help people who are not fluent in a language understand by giving them 2 ways to understand the media's meaning. Some people process information more easily by reading it.

## Captions vs Subtitles

Technically, not the same thing. In the US, "captions" are text meant for deaf audiences, and include descriptions of other sounds. Subtitles are text meant to provide a translation of speech in a language secondary to the media, or clarify a hard-to-hear bit of speech.

## Other benefits of captions

- Search engine optimization
- 2nd-language learners
- Watching video with the sound off

## Auto-Captioning

Good as a starting point from which to create accurate captions.
