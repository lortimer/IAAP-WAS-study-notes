# Background Sounds

Distracting background sounds make it hard for lots of different kinds of people to be able to understand or enjoy media. Environmental noise, music, background speech, and overlapping dialog.

Autoplaying audio is one horrific example of this.

## Background Sounds in Media

People who use hearing aids often have trouble distinguishing the main audio from background sounds because all the sounds they're hearing have been amplified electronically. The same is true for listening to background noise through a headset.

### Background Music

Allowable, but shouldn't overpower the main audio, especially dialog. Drop the volume and choose music that uses frequencies outside the range of human speech.

### Background Noises

Traffic, water flowing, wind, machinery, etc. should all be reduced as much as possible. Use lav mics.

### Overlapping Dialog

Normal dialog is typically overlapping to some degree, but it shouldn't be used in media.

### Background sounds in prerecorded audio-only and prerecorded multimedia content SHOULD be minimized (20dB lower than foreground sounds, except for occasional sounds of no more than 2 seconds) or eliminated during narration or dialog, or a method must be available to turn off background sounds

WCAG AAA

### Background sounds in live audio-only and live multimedia content SHOULD be minimized (20dB lower than foreground sounds, except for occasional sounds of no more than 2 seconds) or eliminated during narration or dialog, or a method must be available to turn off background sounds

Not required by WCAG

## Background Audio on Web Pages

Background audio on a web page is asinine, especially when it plays automatically. It makes it difficult to hear a screen reader, which sucks when you're trying to find the control to turn it off.

### A mechanism MUST be provided to stop, pause, mute, or adjust volume for audio that automatically plays on a page for more than 3 seconds

Better yet, make the audio user-initiated. If you have to auto-play sound, put the control to stop it super early in the document so it's easier to find.
