# CVAA: The 21st Century Video Communications and Accessibility Act

An Industry-Specific law signed in in 2010. Requires "advanced communications services and products" to be accessible. This includes video communications, text messages, web browsers on mobile devicesm etc.

It applies to all entities already covered by Federal Communications Commission regulations, like telecom hardware and software providers, TV broadcasters, and TV hardware/software providers. It also applies to all web content that "previously aired on television and which was subjected to FCC regulations."

## Captioning Requirements

All video presented with captions on television must be presented with closed captions when presented on the internet. This is superceded by WCAG 2.1 which requires this of all video content, not just that which was once shown on television.

### The CVAA captioning requirements apply to:

- All full-length programming delivered to consumers in the United States using the Internet that previously aired with captions on television in the United States.
- Beginning in January 2016, clips of programs (i.e., excerpts of full-length video programs) that previously aired with captions on television in the United States:
    - January 1, 2016: a single video clip of a previously-aired, captioned television program
    - January 1, 2017: multiple video clips of a previously-aired, captioned television program
    - July 1, 2017: video clips of live and near-live programming

### The captioning requirements of the CVAA do NOT apply to:

- User-generated content (e.g., home videos) shown on the Internet, unless they were shown on TV with captions.
  - Interesting note - if I were to publicly publish taped videos of my Dad bowling, they would require captions, because they came from a local TV broadcast from the 1980s, when they would have had captions. 
- Movies shown on the Internet, unless they have been previously shown on TV with captions.
